    rebinding can resolve evil.com TO 127.0.0.1, which matters for every
    endpoint and most of all the PTY websockets. Two header checks kill the

    - Host must be a loopback name. A rebound page's requests carry the
      attacker's hostname, a tunnel or direct local call carries loopback.
    - Origin, when present, must be a loopback origin. Browsers stamp the
      true page origin on every cross-origin request and WebSocket and
      pages cannot forge it; native processes (the agent CLIs, curl, MCP
      clients, the stdio bridge) send no Origin at all. "null" (sandboxed
      iframe / file://) is rejected.

    The MCP spec requires exactly this Origin validation for streamable
    HTTP servers; applied to the whole app because the exposure is shared.
